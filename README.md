## User Story
```
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
```
## Description
This is a node command-line application that can be used to gather information and generate a software engineering team profile. The application will prompt the user for information about the team which includes the manager as well his team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster with summaries of each person based on the information provided by the user.

This ```team.html``` file is generated dynamically from user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). 

Application Development: 
[Inquirer npm package](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/) has been used to prompt the user for details like name, email, id, and specific information based on their role with the company. For instance, an intern may provide their school, whereas an engineer may provide their GitHub username. The different employee types all inherit some methods and properties from a base class of `Employee`.
[jest](https://jestjs.io/) is used for running the provided tests. All the unit tests have been run using `npm run test`and have passed.
